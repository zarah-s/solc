- [x] make return for tupple an array (the return should be an array of different values)
- [x] make tupple inference to functions (extract tupple as variables from function that returns tupple)
- [x] identify storage locations for primitive datatypes in function definitions
- [x] identify view for function

- [x] cover for loops
- [x] complete while loops
- [x] complete conditional statements

- [x] parse cron syntax

- [x] parse full contract with inheritance

- [x] disallow `gasless` keyword if function is a view function

- [] parse interface

- [] test interface interaction and implementation

- [] test inherited constructor initialization

- [] test contract-variable assign
